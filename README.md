# Rationale
In the past, I avoided creating a github repository for my code if I was
following a tutorial or tackling toy problems. I told myself that if the code
wasn't useful to others, then there was no purpose in sharing it.

However, while I am not attempting anything that hasn't been done before, this
repository is a good place to track my progress and display it for potential
employers.
